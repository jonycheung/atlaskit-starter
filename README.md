# Atlaskit starter

This is a basic app which includes some Atlaskit components, built on top of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can use this as a starting point for your next ADG3-themed project.

A live demo is available at [http://atlaskit-starter.surge.sh/](http://atlaskit-starter.surge.sh/)

## Getting started

```bash
yarn # if you don't have yarn, install with: npm install -g yarn
npm run start
```

## Using more Atlaskit components

This repo ships with a couple of Atlaskit components such as `@atlaskit/navigation`.

You can add other components (listed at [http://go.atlassian.com/ak](http://go.atlassian.com/ak)) to your project:

```bash
yarn add @atlaskit/button
```

Then in the relevant React component file (e.g. `src/App.jsx`) do the following:

```js
import Button from '@atlaskit/button';

// ...

render() {
  <Page>
    <Button>My button text</Button>
  </Page>
}
```

## Want some help?

This repo is helpful for people using Atlaskit + React for the first time. If you've had a look and have more questions, please contact the team in the "Atlaskit" Stride room.
